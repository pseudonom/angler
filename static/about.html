    This is a quick experiment based on the oft-heard writing advice that one should prefer Anglo-Saxon words to Latinate words (for example, Orwell's <a href="https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm">Politics and the English language</a>).

    I tried keep the illuminated manuscript design historically accurate. Sources include:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminated_manuscript">
          Wikipedia—Illuminated Manuscript</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/introduction.asp">
          Online Catalogue of Illuminated Manuscripts</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://calligraphypen.wordpress.com/tag/illuminated-manuscripts/">
          Simple Drawn and Painted Borders</a></li>
    </ul>
    The typeface is off by several centuries. It's a concession to legibility while attempting to remain evocative.
